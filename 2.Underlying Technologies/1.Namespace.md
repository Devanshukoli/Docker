- So, it's core technology for *docker*.

## What exactly are these namespaces?
- It's _linux kernel_ feature that allows isolation of various system resorces, making it possible for a process and its children to have a view of a subset of the system that is seperate from other processes.
- Below are namespaces in linux, 
    1. **PID** (Process IDs) : Isolates the process ID number space, which means that process within a container only see their own process, not those on the host or in other containers.
    2. **Network** (NET) : Provides each container with a seperate view of the network stack, including its own network interfaces routing tables, and firewall rules.
    3. **Mount** (MNT) : Isolates the file system mount points in such a way that each container has its own root file system, and mounted resources appear only within that container.
    4. **UTS** (Unix Time Sharing System) : Allows each container to have its own hostname and domain name, separate from other containers and the host system.
    5. **User** (USER) : Maps user and group identifiers between the container and the host, so different permissions can be set for resources within the container.
    6. **IPC** (Inter-Process Communication) : Allows or restricts the communication between processes in diff. container.

## How Docker uses Namespaces?
- Docker uses namespaces to create isolated environments for containers. 
    - When a container is started, Docker creates a new set of namespaces for that container.
    - These namespaces only apply within the container, so any processes running inside the container have access to a subset of system resources that are isolated from other containers as well as the host system.

- By leveraging namespaces, Docker ensures that containers are truly portable and can run on any system without conflicts or interference from other processes or containers running on the same host.

- In summary, namespaces provide a level of resource isolation that enables running multiple containers with separate system resources within the same host, without them interfering with each other. This is a critical feature that forms the backbone of Dockerâ€™s container technology.
