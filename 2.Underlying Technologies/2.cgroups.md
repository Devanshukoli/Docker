- **cgroups** or **Control Groups** is also one of the core technology in docker.

- It allocate and manage resource, such as CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and I/O, among groups of processes running on a system.
    - It plays a crucial role in providing resource isolation and limiting the resource that a running container can use.

- Docker utilize cgroups to enforce constraints on containers, allowing them to have a consistent and predictable behaviour.

- Below is feature of **cgroups** in context to _docker containers_.
    1. **Resouce Isolation** : cgroups helps to confine each container to a specific set of resources, ensuring fair sharing of system resources among multiple containers.
    2. **Limiting Resources** : With cgroups, you can set limits on various system resources used by a container, such as CPU, memory, and I/O.
    3. **Prioritizing Containers** : By allocating different shares of resouces, cgroups allows you to give preference or priority to certain containers.
        - This can be useful in scenarios where some containers are more critical than others, or during high resource contention situations.
    4. **Monitoring** : cgroups also have mechanisms for monitoring the resource usage of individual containers, which helps to gain insights into container performance and identify potential resource bottlenecks.
