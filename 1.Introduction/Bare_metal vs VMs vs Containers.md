# Some Terms 

## Bare Metal
- Bare metal is term used to describe a computer that is running directly on the hardware without any virtulization.
- This is the most performant way to run an application, but it is also the least flexible.
- You can only run one applicatoin per server, and you cannot easily move the application to another server.

## Virtual Machines.
- Virtual machines (VMs) are a way to run mulitple application on a single server. 
- Each VM runs on top of a *hypervisor*, which is a piece of software that emulates the hardware of computer.
- The hypervisor allows you to run mulitple operating systems on a single server, and it also provides isolation between application running on diff. VMs.

## Containers.
- *Containers* are a way to run multiple applications ona single server without the overhead of a hypervisor.
- Each container runs on top of a container  engne, which is a piece of software that emulates the operating system of a computer. 
- The container engine allows you to run multiple applications on a single server, and it also provides isolation between applications running on different containers
